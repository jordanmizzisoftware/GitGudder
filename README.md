# GitGudder
GitGudder is a training routine organizer made to increase productivity when practicing for competition. 

I have made a new repository for GitGudder separate from my initial one so that I may cut away any of the uncessary documentation and file clutter from other projects, as many others may download the source material. 

This Readme file is the official beginning of this.
